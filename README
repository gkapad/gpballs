\o/ the gpballs

This was a try to share packages with myself,
that was in their born, or not sure, if were worth to publish.

All this packages, was tar-balls, signed with a private 'gpg' key,
so were private, and hidden, somehow.

And, so, thats their name. gpballs ;)

the try was succes but unusable,
cause git have to handle with binary files,
and sometimes huge enough,
and the sync become very slow, and heavy
